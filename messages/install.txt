# Sublime Text JavaScript Prettier

## Install Prettier

    If you installed Prettier globally (using the npm command below), there is
    nothing else you need to do.

    You may be required to specify the path to prettier executable, which is
    configurable in the Package's settings File,
    "Preferences" > "Package Settings" > "JsPrettier" > "Settings - User".


## Usage

    To run the JsPrettier command... open the Sublime Text Command Palette
    (shift + super + p), and type "JsPrettier: Format JavaScript".


## Settings

    All Prettier options are configurable from the "JsPrettier.sublime-settings"
    file, accessible from the "Preferences" > "Package Settings" > "JsPrettier"
    menu shortcut.
