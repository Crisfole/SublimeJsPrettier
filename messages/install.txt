# Sublime Text JavaScript Prettier

    A Sublime Text Plug-in for Prettier, the opinionated JavaScript formatter.


## Install Prettier

    If you installed Prettier globally (using the npm command below), there is
    nothing else you need to do.

        npm install -g prettier

    You may be required to specify the path to the `prettier` executable, which
    is configurable in the Package's settings file...

        -> "Preferences"
        -> "Package Settings"
        -> "JsPrettier"
            -> "Settings - User"


## Usage

    To run the JsPrettier command... open the Sublime Text Command Palette
    (super + shift + p), and type "JsPrettier".

    You can also right-click anywhere in the file (JavaScript Syntax only) to
    bring up the Context Menu, then select "JsPrettier" to execute the command.

    ### Command Scope

    The `JsPrettier` command will attempt to format any selected JavaScript sections
    of code first; if no selections are made, the entire file will be formatted.

    > NOTE: When the `auto_format_on_save` setting is set to `true`, the entire file
    > will always be formatted.

    ### Custom Key Binding

    To add a custom key binding to execute the JsPrettier command at will, please
    reference the following example, which binds to "ctrl/cmd + b".

        { "keys": ["super+b"], "command": "js_prettier" }

## Settings

    All Prettier options are configurable from the "JsPrettier.sublime-settings"
    file, accessible from the "JsPrettier" menu item...

        -> "Preferences"
        -> "Package Settings"
        -> "JsPrettier"
            -> "Settings - Default" (To view the default settings)
            -> "Settings - User"    (To override the default settings)
